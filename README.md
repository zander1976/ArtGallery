# Art Gallery

This is an art gallery using HTML5 with local caching and a fake GraphQL developed in PHP. Each area does have the ability to cache to reduce network and database load. This was for a 4th year Web development course at university. A lot of the code was removed as it was part of the assignemnt and I was overly greedy with my delete as to not keep anybody elses code in there.
